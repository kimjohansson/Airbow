This is the open source code to my master's thesis "Airbow - An Anthropomimetic Elbow with Dual Pneumatic Actuators".
If you want to make your own Airbow, there is a list of materials below and I recommend that you check out the pictures and videos on my instagram account here: https://www.instagram.com/theairbowproject/

If you plan on making your own Airbow or something similar, don't hesitate to contact me and I'll be happy to help you.

Tools etc.
* 3D printer
* Soldering station
* "Helping hand" with alligator clips
* Multimeter
* Rotary tool (drill and sandpaper works if you don't have one)
* Glue gun
*  Zip ties
*  Electrical tape
*  Heatshrink tube
*  Solder
*  Wires
*  Screws
*  Distance bolts
*  Nuts
*  Metal washers
*  Plastic washers
*  Wire cutter
*  Needle-nose pliers
*  Wire stripper
*  Stainless- or galvanized steel wire 

Pneumatic Control Board			
* 30x30x6mm	Acrylic sheet	
* 1 pcs	0-32 PSI Diaphragm air pump	https://www.electrokit.com/productFile/download/2269
* 2 pcs	133Pa 3/2-way Solenoid valve (N.C.)	https://www.elfa.se/Web/Downloads/at/_e/vbVDW_dat_e.pdf?mime=application%2Fpdf
* 1 pcs	Arduino MEGA	
* 2 pcs	Breadboard	
* 4 pcs	6 mm Straight plug-in connector	
* 6 pcs	6 mm Angle plug-in connector	
* 2 pcs	6 mm Bulkhead plug-in connector	
* 1 pcs	6 mm Y-branch plug-in connector	
* 1 pcs	12VDC 16amp Rocker switch	
* 2 pcs	12VDC 20amp Toggle switch	
* 2 pcs	10 kOhm Linear potentiometer	https://www.elfa.se/Web/Downloads/_t/ds/p160_eng_tds.pdf?mime=application%2Fpdf
* more than 2 m	Pneumatic tubing 6mm outer diameter	
* 5 pcs	10 kOhm resistor	
* 3 pcs	STP55NF06L MOSFET	https://www.elfa.se/Web/Downloads/l_/en/uaSTM-PowerMOSFET-STx-55NF06L_EN.pdf?mime=application%2Fpdf
* Bench power supply or anything that can supply 12 VDC > 1 A and 24 VDC > 0.14 A*			
			
*The valves are rated at 24 VDC and the pump at 12 VDC, but the pump drains so much power that the 12 VDC output on the bench power supply hit the ampere limit of 0.5 A. As a quick fix I had to connect both the pump and valves to the same power output with 2.5 A limit and found that 14 VDC seemed to work ok for both pump and valves. However, you should consider this when choosing power supply. The valves drain around 0.14 A together and the pump can go as high as 1 A when a PAM is close to maximally inflated.			

Pneumatic Artificial Muscle			
* more than 1 m	18-55 mm Cable sleeving	
* 4 pcs (buy at least 50)	Oblong balloons	
* 2 pcs	6 mm Angle plug-in connector	
* 2 pcs	9-13 mm Hose clamp		
* 2 pcs	Plastic caps 17 mm outer diameter	
* Nylon and fluorocarbon fishing line (8 kg)	
* 2 pcs	Crimp ends (jewelry making supply)	
	
The Airbow			
* 1 pcs	10 kOhm Linear potentiometer with a long shaft
* 23 cm + 6 cm Metal rod
* ABS 3D-printing filament
* 3D files* of the humerus, ulna and radius that can be downloaded here: http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/?lng=en 
* Silicone pot holder (for the ligaments)
* Synthetic satin ribbon
* Metal framework	
* Something that will let you attach the dome top of the humerus securely to a metal frame*	
* 4 pcs	Screw eye pins	
  
*mine were printed at 90% size and yes, you do need to make them smoother both in any 3D printing software you have and after           printing with a rotary tool or sandpaper.

*This can be very tricky! I ended up using a piece of metal that held the heatsink in place over the CPU on my old HP laptop. It looked kind of like an "H" but with two horizontal bars in the middle instead of one.
